These are queries from the "Learning SQL Programing" course, hosted by LinkedIn Learning. The database contained two tables (people, states) from which the data was pulled.
I completed the course on 5/24/2022.

-- Using ORDER BY to organize responses
SELECT first_name,last_name,team, shirt_or_hat
from people
order by shirt_or_hat, team 

--Using JOINS to retrieve data from more than one table. 

SELECT people.first_name, people.last_name, people.state_code, states.state_name, states.state_abbrev
from states
LEFT JOIN people 
on people.state_code=states.state_abbrev

--Using DISTINCT and JOIN to determine the states where no people are from

SELECT DISTINCT (people.state_code), states.state_abbrev
from states
Left JOIN people 
on people.state_code=states.state_abbrev 
order by people.state_code

--Create a QUERY showing how many hats need to be shipped to each state name 

Select states.state_name, people.shirt_or_hat, count(people.shirt_or_hat)
from states
JOIN people
ON states.state_abbrev=people.state_code 
WHERE shirt_or_hat='hat'
Group by people.shirt_or_hat, states.state_name 

Create a QUERY showing how many members of each team are in each geographic division

Select states.division, people.team, count(people.team)
from states
JOIN people
on people.state_code=states.state_abbrev
Group by states.division, people.team 
	
--Show maximum quiz score and average quiz score for each state. Sort with the state with the highest average score is at the top of the results.

SELECT states.state_name, Max (people.quiz_points)as max_score, AVG (people.quiz_points) as average_score
from states
JOIN people
On states.state_abbrev=people.state_code 
Group by states.state_name
ORDER by average_score DESC 

--INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE data from the DATABASE

INSERT INTO people 
(first_name, last_name, city, state_code, shirt_or_hat, quiz_points, team)
VALUES 
('Walter','St. John','Buffalo','NY','hat','93','Baffled Badgers'),
('Emerald','Chou','Topeka','KS','shirt','92','Angry Ants')*/

--Bonnie Brooks wants a shirt, not a hat (updating records)
UPDATE people
SET shirt_or_hat="shirt"
WHERE id_number=12

--Lois Hart requests to be removed from our list

DELETE from people 
WHERE first_name="Lois" and last_name="Hart"
